# Bacteria-to-Beef
Plotly and Belly Button Diversity

# Purpose:
Improbable Beef needs to use belly button bacteria data in order to identify a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef.  This project allows visualization of  the bacterial data for each volunteer. 

# Results:
 The designed site allows the volunteers to select their Volunteer ID from a drop down menu in order to access their data. The information that volunteers will be able to see includes the top 10 bacterium that resides within their belly buttons on a bar chart, the amount of each bacteria found in their belly button visualized through a bubble chart, and the frequency of washing their belly button undergoes in a gauge chart to allow them to see a possible connection between washing frequency and the amount of bacteria in their belly button.
 
# Summary:
 Interactive charts allow comprehensive understanding of belly button bacteria for each volunteer and ensures that the study is as transparent as possible for the participants.
